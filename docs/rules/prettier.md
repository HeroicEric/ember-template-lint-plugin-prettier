# prettier

Runs [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) as a rule. If the code matches prettier output, no issue is raised.

It will use the project's local version of Prettier. Note that `prettier` and `ember-template-lint` are required as peerDependencies of the package that bundles this prettier rule.
